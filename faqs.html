          Trade Forex & CFDs with a Market Leader
          <br /><br />
          <strong>1. What is Forex?</strong>
          <br />
          Forex, also known as foreign exchange or FX, is the simultaneous
          buying of one currency while selling another. The forex market is
          available 24 hours a day, five days a week and it’s one of the
          largest, most liquid financial markets in the world. Just to compare,
          the United Kindom Stock Exchange makes about $169 billion a day in
          volume and the Forex Market makes over $5 trillion a day in volume.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>2. Is Forex trading expensive?</strong>
          <br />
          It depends on the leverage and capital invested. You can have a
          starting capital of as low as $250, or as high you want. However, it
          is important to remember that increasing leverage increases risk; but
          ultimately depends on the investor’s appetite for risk.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>3. How are currency prices determined?</strong>
          <br />
          There are various ways currency prices can change. Economic and
          political conditions usually affect the value of a currency, along
          with interest rates and inflation.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>4. What tools do I need to trade Forex?</strong>
          <br />
          You only need a computer with internet connection and a free demo
          account or a funded live account with MTrading to start. However, you
          should be equipped with proper Forex education and tools to minimize
          risks in the Forex market.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>5. How does Forex trading work?</strong>
          <br />
          Forex is traded in currency pairs. Common currency pairs are the
          Euro/US Dollar, US Dollar/Japanese Yen, Great British Pound/US Dollar,
          and US Dollar/Canadian Dollar. You buy one currency and automatically
          sell another.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>6. Where is the central location of the Forex market?</strong>
          <br />
          Forex trading is not centralized on an exchange, as with the stock and
          futures markets. The Forex market is considered an Over-the-Counter
          (OTC) or ‘Interbank’ market, due to the fact that transactions are
          conducted between two counterparts over the telephone or via an
          electronic network.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>7. Where can I learn more about Forex trading?</strong>
          <br />
          We offer a range of educational tools which include free trainings &
          seminars, webinars and video tutorials to enhance your Forex
          knowledge. Please visit our education section
          <br /><br />
          <strong>8. What are the trading hours for the Forex market?</strong>
          <br />
          The Forex market is open 24 hours a day. It opens on Sunday at 10:00
          pm GMT, and closes on Friday at 10:00 pm GMT:Sydney opens at 10:00 pm
          to 7:00 am GMTTokyo opens at 12:00 am to 9:00 am GMTLondon opens at
          8:00 am to 5:00 pm GMTNew York opens at 1:00 pm to 10:00 pm GMT
          <br /><br />
          <strong>9. Who are the participants in the Forex market?</strong>
          <br />
          The Forex market is called an ‘Interbank’ market due to the fact that
          historically it has been dominated by banks, including Central Banks,
          commercial banks, and investment banks. However, the percentage of
          other market participants is rapidly growing and now the list includes
          large multinational corporations, global money managers, registered
          dealers, international money brokers, futures and options traders, and
          individual investors.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>10. How do I profit from trading Forex?</strong>
          <br />
          The sum of your profit depends on the efficiency of your trading
          strategy, on how well you will learn to predict the alteration in
          rates tendency and a little on the amount of your deposit which allows
          you to sustain unfavorable situations during market movements.
